# Python Automation Scripts

Welcome to my Python Automation Scripts repository! ðŸŽ‰

## About
This repository is a collection of automation scripts that I have developed to streamline various aspects of my personal and professional workflow. Each script is designed to help automate repetitive tasks, improve productivity, and simplify daily routines.

As I continue to work on more automation solutions, I will add them here.

## Purpose
The purpose of these scripts is to automate tasks that:
- Save time and reduce manual effort.
- Solve specific personal or work-related needs.
- Just want to write something cool and make life easier!

## Scripts
Below is a list of current and planned scripts, along with their descriptions:

1. **GitHub Repo Automation** - Automates the process of creating a new GitHub repository
2. **New Product Checker** (planned) - Checks if new merch from your favorite brand is out and sends you an email automatically.
   
## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tsaichenlo/automation-scripts.git
